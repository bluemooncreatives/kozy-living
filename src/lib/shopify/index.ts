/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   How long Shopify data may go stale

   Every cached call carries a TAG and a TTL, and it needs both.

   The tag is the fast path: Shopify POSTs a webhook to `/api/revalidate` when a
   product, collection, blog or metaobject changes, and that clears the tag
   immediately. When it is wired up, the site is seconds behind the Admin.

   The TTL is the floor, and it is the part that was missing. `cache:
   "force-cache"` with tags alone means Next holds a response FOREVER until a
   webhook says otherwise - so on any store where the webhooks are not
   registered, or that is running on localhost where Shopify cannot reach it,
   the catalogue freezes at whatever it was the first time it was fetched and
   never moves again. That is exactly what happened here: colour metafields
   added in Admin did not appear on the site at all, because the site was still
   serving a day-old copy of the catalogue.

   A webhook is an optimisation. The TTL is the guarantee.

   Development defaults to no caching at all, so editing Shopify and refreshing
   the browser shows the change. Production defaults to a minute, which is short
   enough to feel live and long enough that a burst of traffic does not walk the
   whole catalogue once per visitor. `SHOPIFY_CACHE_SECONDS` overrides both.
